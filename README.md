===================
Idea:
This project is designed to make crazy photomanipulation (ex. datamoshing, jpeg corruption) very easy and accessable. In theory, this should be minimalist, cross-platform, user-friendly photomanipulation software.

Work in progress. In no state to show off. I just felt like getting the repo set up.



Big changes and additions in the future (that I can think of right now):
 - Will be setting up some simple console gui (using curses FOR NOW). I have some code for that lying around somewhere. Not sure how that will work out for OSX users on account of not really ever touching OSX shells. OSX is really my 3rd priority here anyways...
 - Will be getting several filetype demos up and running. JPEGs are a bitch.
 - Will be adding addon functionality. User will be able to put dynamic link libs in a directory and use them to add functionality. Be forewarned, the way I am implimenting this addon system is not very safe (as you will see when implimented), but it will be simple and quick. This is a personal project that I want to get in some sort of completed state in the not too distant future.

This is a side project. I will work on it as much as I possibly can. Time between updates will greatly vary.
